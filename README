GENERAL INFORMATION
-------------------

This repository contains shell scripts meant to help converting Octave
function files (M-files) to Matlab function files.

Please be aware that they are not full fledged Octave to Matlab translators
and the output files won't be valid Matlab function files if the input files
make use of Octave specific language features other than:

        - Pound sign ("#") used as comment leader on lines that contain only a
          comment.

        - "end_try_catch", "endfor", "endfunction", "endif", "endswitch" and
          "endwhile" used to close the various control constructs.

Their primary purpose is to turn Octave style M-file headers (with copyright
sections and texinfo help sections) into Matlab style headers.

Read the documentations below for details.

The scripts have been validated on a Debian GNU/Linux system, with dash as
/bin/sh.

DOCUMENTATION FOR SCRIPT octaveh2matlabh
----------------------------------------

Usage:

    octaveh2matlabh [OPTIONS] OCT_M_FILE [DEST_DIR]

    octaveh2matlabh -h|--help

Description:

    Turn an Octave style function file (M-file) to a Matlab style file.

    The first argument is the Octave style function file.  If it is -,
    then input is read from standard input.

    The second argument is the directory in which octaveh2matlabh writes
    the Matlab style file.  If it is omitted, then the Matlab style file is
    written to the current working directory.

    The primary action of octaveh2matlabh is to turn an Octave style M-file
    header (with a copyright section and then a texinfo help section)
    into a Matlab style header (with a plain text help section and then a
    copyright section).

    Note that if no texinfo help section is found in the Octave style function
    file, then in the Matlab style file the copyright section is placed at
    the end of the file.

    You may want to read the following Web pages about the conventional
    headers for Octave functions:

        - www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/Function-Headers.html

        - www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/Documentation-Tips.html

    The secondary action of octaveh2matlabh is to slighly modify the body of
    the function.  The modifications do not change the functional behavior
    of the function.  The modifications are as follows:

        - On the lines that contain only the word "end_try_catch", this
        word is replaced with "end".  Leading blanks are preserved, trailing
        blanks are discarded.

        - Ditto for the words "endfor", "endfunction", "endif", "endswitch"
        and "endwhile".

        - On the lines that contain only a comment with one or more pound
        signs ("#") used as comment leaders, the pound signs are substituted
        with a single percent sign ("%").

    Please be aware that the output file will not be a valid Matlab function
    file if the input file makes use of other Octave specific language
    features.

    One of the texi2any or makeinfo commands is used to process the texinfo
    help section and produce a plain text help section.  texi2any or makeinfo
    may write warning or error messages to standard error.  By default, these
    messages are discarded.  If the -k or --makeinfo-err option is used,
    then the messages are not discarded.

    If the -t or --makeinfo-input option is used, then the input to makeinfo
    is echoed to standard output.

    If the -f or --force option is used, then the output file is overwritten
    without confirmation.

Options:

    -k, --makeinfo-err
        Do not discard makeinfo warning and error messages.

    -t, --makeinfo-input
        Write the makeinfo input to standard output.

    -f, --force
        Overwrite output file without confirmation.

    -h, --help
        Display this documentation and exit.

DOCUMENTATION FOR SCRIPT octaveh2matlabh_recursive
--------------------------------------------------

Usage:

    octaveh2matlabh_recursive [OPTIONS] SOURCE_DIR [DEST_DIR]

    octaveh2matlabh_recursive -h|--help

Description:

    Calls octaveh2matlabh for every file with ".m" extension in source
    directory and its subdirectories.  The subdirectory structure is duplicated
    in destination directory.  Note that files and directories having a name
    starting with "." are ignored.

    One of the texi2any or makeinfo commands is used to process the texinfo
    help section in the octaveh2matlabh input files and produce a plain text
    help section.  texi2any or makeinfo may write warning or error messages
    to standard error.  By default, these messages are discarded.  If the
    -k or --makeinfo-err option is used, then the messages are not discarded.

    If the -f or --force option is used, then the output files are overwritten
    without confirmation.

    If the -q or --quiet option is used, then the processed files are not
    listed on standard output.

Options:

    -k, --makeinfo-err
        Do not discard makeinfo warning and error messages.

    -f, --force
        Overwrite output files without confirmation.

    -q, --quiet
        Do not list files on standard output.

    -h, --help
        Display this documentation and exit.

TEST PROGRAM
------------

The test repository contains the test_octaveh2matlabh script which is a test
program for the scripts mentioned above. It is supposed to terminate with exit
status 0 and a "Test passed." line written to standard output. A non zero exit
status or a "Test failed." line written to standard output indicates that
scripts octaveh2matlabh and octaveh2matlabh_recursive do not work properly.
